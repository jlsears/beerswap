Ever find yourself in the super unfortunate position of excitedly picking up a new six-pack of a potentially tasty brew at the store to try out, only to discover you can't abide the idea of needing to down the remaining five after you have the first? Or you totally remembered enjoying this summer ale at that thing last July, but now that you've procured some to have at home, the memory and the beer currently sitting in your fridge just don't match up?

You don't feel like you can just let this personally displeasing brew go to waste. But can't embrace the idea of sipping the rest of it down yourself, either. 

Well this app seeks to help resolve these saddening but sometimes just unavoidable beer lover conundrums. 

Now you can just log into your friendly beer swapping app and post information on these beers that need a new home. And then hopefully some kind soul will offer a trade with beers that sound acceptable to you, and tasty beer equanimity will be restored! Or say if somebody doesn't have any acceptable-sounding beers to trade at the moment, but you can see via their user history that they have a good record of participation and have maybe even paid into the system by trading out beers before when someone else had nothing to provide in exchange at that the time... well then even that can be done, too. Whatever sits right with you.

So in essence, by registering for this app you will be able to:

•	Log into (and out of) your account.
•	Post beers for swapping, with information including:
  o	Name of beer.
  o	Quantity available.
  o	Note containing any other pertinent details.
•	Delete beers that I have posted for swapping.
•	Make edits to a post I have made for swapping.
  o	Edits to name of beer, quantity available, or details in notes
•	Accept beers that someone has posted for swapping.
  o	Users can then coordinate as need via email, phone call, etc. to hash out details of the swap.
•	See history of a user’s prior participation in swaps.
